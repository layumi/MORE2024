## Abstract
Object re-identification (or object re-ID) has gained significant attention in recent years, fueled by the increasing demand for advanced video analysis and safety systems. In object
re-identification, a query can be of different modalities, such as an image, a video, or natural language, containing or describing the object of interest. 
This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in object re-identification to delve into the latest advancements, challenges, and opportunities in this dynamic field. The workshop covers a spectrum of topics related to object re-identification, including but not limited to deep metric learning, multi-view data generation, video-based object re-identification, cross-domain object re-identification and real-world applications.
The workshop provides a platform for researchers to showcase their work, exchange ideas, and foster potential collaborations. Additionally, it serves as a valuable opportunity for practitioners to stay abreast of the latest developments in object re-identification technology.
Overall, this workshop creates a unique space to explore the rapidly evolving field of object re-identification and its profound impact on advancing the capabilities of multimedia analysis and retrieval.

**Key Words**  Multimedia Retrieval, Object Re-identification, Representation Learning, Deep Metric Learning, Multi-view Generation 

**The list of possible topics includes, but is not limited to:**
* New Datasets and Benchmarks
* Deep Metric Learning
* Multi-view Data Generation
